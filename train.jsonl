But if you get the facts about saving and investing and follow through with an intelligent plan, you should be able to gain financial security over the years and enjoy the benefits of managing your money.\u00a0\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Evaluate your comfort zone in taking on risk.", "source": "best_practices.txt"}

If you intend to purchase securities - such as stocks, bonds, or mutual funds - it's important that you understand before you invest that you could lose some or all of your money.\u00a0 Unlike deposits at FDIC-insured banks and NCUA-insured credit unions, the money you invest in securities typically is not federally insured.\u00a0 You could lose your principal, which is the amount you've invested.\u00a0 That\u2019s true even if you purchase your investments through a bank.\nThe reward for taking on risk is the potential for a greater investment return. If you have a financial goal with a long time horizon, you are likely to make more money by carefully investing in asset categories with greater risk, like stocks or bonds, rather than restricting your investments to assets with less risk, like cash equivalents. On the other hand, investing solely in cash investments may be appropriate for short-term financial goals.\u00a0 The principal concern for individuals investing in cash equivalents is inflation risk, which is the risk that inflation will outpace and erode returns over time.\nFederally Insured Deposits at Banks and Credit Unions --\u00a0If you\u2019re not sure if your deposits are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government, it\u2019s easy to find out.\u00a0 For bank accounts, go to www.myfdicinsurance.gov.\u00a0 For credit union accounts, go to http://webapps.ncua.gov/Ins/.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Consider an appropriate mix of investments.", "source": "best_practices.txt"}

{"id": 3, "text": "Lifecycle Funds -- To accommodate investors who prefer to use one investment to save for a particular investment goal, such as retirement, some mutual fund companies have begun offering a product known as a \"lifecycle fund.\" A lifecycle fund is a diversified mutual fund that automatically shifts towards a more conservative mix of investments as it approaches a particular year in the future, known as its \"target date.\" A lifecycle fund investor picks a fund with the right target date based on his or her particular investment goal. The managers of the fund then make all decisions about asset allocation, diversification, and rebalancing. It's easy to identify a lifecycle fund because its name will likely refer to its target date. For example, you might see lifecycle funds with names like \"Portfolio 2015,\" \"Retirement Fund 2030,\" or \"Target 2045.\u201d\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Be careful if investing heavily in shares of employer\u2019s stock or any individual stock.\nOne of the most important ways to lessen the risks of investing is to diversify your investments. It\u2019s common sense: don't put all your eggs in one basket.\u00a0 By picking the right group of investments within an asset category, you may be able to limit your losses and reduce the fluctuations of investment returns without sacrificing too much potential gain.\u00a0\nYou\u2019ll be exposed to significant investment risk if you invest heavily in shares of your employer\u2019s stock or any individual stock.\u00a0 If that stock does poorly or the company goes bankrupt, you\u2019ll probably lose a lot of money (and perhaps your job).\u00a0\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Create and maintain an emergency fund.\u00a0\nMost smart investors put enough money in a savings product to cover an emergency, like sudden unemployment.\u00a0 Some make sure they have up to six months of their income in savings so that they know it will absolutely be there for them when they need it.\u00a0\n6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Pay off high interest credit card debt.", "source": "best_practices.txt"}

If you owe money on high interest credit cards, the wisest thing you can do under any market conditions is to pay off the balance in full as quickly as possible.\u00a0\n7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Consider dollar cost averaging.\nThrough the investment strategy known as \u201cdollar cost averaging,\u201d you can protect yourself from the risk of investing all of your money at the wrong time by following a consistent pattern of adding new money to your investment over a long period of time.\u00a0 By making regular investments with the same amount of money each time, you will buy more of an investment when its price is low and less of the investment when its price is high.\u00a0 Individuals that typically make a lump-sum contribution to an individual retirement account either at the end of the calendar year or in early April may want to consider \u201cdollar cost averaging\u201d as an investment strategy, especially in a volatile market.\u00a0\n8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Take advantage of \u201cfree money\u201d from employer.\u00a0\nIn many employer-sponsored retirement plans, the employer will match some or all of your contributions.\u00a0 If your employer offers a retirement plan and you do not contribute enough to get your employer\u2019s maximum match, you are passing up \u201cfree money\u201d for your retirement savings.\u00a0\nKeep Your Money Working -- In most cases, a workplace plan is the most effective way to save for retirement.\u00a0 Consider your options carefully before borrowing from your retirement plan.\u00a0 In particular, avoid using a 401(k) debit card, except as a last resort.\u00a0 Money you borrow now will reduce the savings vailable to grow over the years and ultimately what you have when you retire.\u00a0 Also, if you don\u2019t repay the loan, you may pay federal income taxes and penalties.", "source": "best_practices.txt"}
